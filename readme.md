# Cinecraft
![Cinecraft logo, a cow](dall-e_2022-07-30_14.22.05_-_256_x_256_pixel_art_of_a_cow.png)
Meaning of the name: popular voxel game implementation, but written in C. Should be pronounced with a hard 'C' sould, akin to a 'k', so that then a pun can be used to make the mascot of the project a cow. Thanks DALLÂ·E for the icon.

### Requirements
As of now, Cinecraft requires a *nix system in order to run, as it requires on pthreads for multithreading and unix sockets for networking. Other than that, all dependencies are pulled in as git submodules.

### Building
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/amusingimpala75/cinecraft.git
cd cinecraft
git submodules update
make
```
The executable is aptly named 'cinecraft'.

### Running
``` sh
/path/to/executable/cinecraft folder-for-data-storage
```
ie: ./cinecraft test
